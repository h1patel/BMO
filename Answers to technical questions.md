## Technical questions & Answers

**How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.**

This technical test took me 3-4 hours and with more time and effort, I could have enhance this project by
- Predefining all Utilities to handle Alerts, frames, Wait, ExcelReader, JSE..
- Adding TestNG Listeners so I can use it to trigger some actions on Test failing, skipping or for retry etc..
- Adding reporting feature such as Cucucmber-Extent report
- Adding Screen shot feature, which can be trigger in listeners and can be used in reports
- Making this test data driven for certain features such as try with different user name etc..
- Reading data from object repositories for test options and driver config
- Parallel execution and make it able to run on different browsers

**What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?**
Test automation trend can have different meanings and understanding but trend in a way of making automation most reliable and successful, In my opinion its by using Selenium with Java in TestNG framework for various testing and Selenium with Cucumber for UAT and of course GitHub (or any other preferred option) for Version Control and Jenkins for Continuous Integration is one of the Key add on!!. The reason for all this open source tools choices is of course because its open source but also there is lots of support available online for bugs and all the hiccups you may get in your way specially for Java, there is lot more support available online than any other options available in Selenium

**How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?**

I never had chance to work on a legacy migration project but speaking out of experience, while working on any migration project, its a best practice to start with manual testing and as the system migrated and implement in to a new stable system automation can be started with careful prioritization of the manual tests

**How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?**
To express my opinion about improvements on Just-Eat.co.uk, I need through understanding of their operations and the services they providing through this platform and so for now I will refrain from making any comment as such!!
